## For Devs
1) Use prism for your launcher.
2) Fork Lizards repo
3) Clone the repo
4) In prism, make a new modpack, select 1.21.1 for game verison, select Neoforge for the loader, select 21.1.213 for Neoforge.
5) Open the modpack folder, and enter in to the minecraft folder
6) Add packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar from [here](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases) into that minecraft foleder
7) In prism, edit the instance you just made, then go to settings -> custom commands -> toggle the custom command button
8) In pre launch command, add ``"$INST_JAVA" -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar http://localhost:8080/pack.toml``
9) Goto where you cloned the repo, and open a termial there. (can type cmd in the search to open it there)
10) Run ``packwiz serve``, you should see ``Loading modpack... Running on port 8080``
11) Launch your modpack in prism.
12) packwiz *should* pull all the files needed from the repo, creating a modpack instance that is upto date with your clone

Once this is done, anytime you want to use that dev instance, make sure to run the ``packwiz serve`` in your repo, so your instances can get any fresh changes

# ALSO
When making a commnit, PLEASE exlude the pack.toml and index.toml, they are local caches that change. they break everythign when commited

Also DM if you get stuck :)
